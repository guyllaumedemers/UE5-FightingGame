# UE5-FightingGame

> Input Mapping uses Gamepad Setup which natively support XBOX Controller ONLY. To Run commands using PS4/PS5 Controller, Additional requirements are needed. PLEASE install [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows).

## Why not use Enhance Input System?

> My current understanding of UE5 Enhance Input System let me to believe that the system is limited to multiple assigned key for a single input trigger Action AND can handle a Modifier key with the trigger if needed BUT cannot have a combination of two input entry to trigger a single action which is what im looking for. Either way, it's way more fun to build something out of nothing.

## Tasks
- [ ] Generate Custom Input Handling System using bitmask value for Combo String
- [ ] Input Parse Entries, Convert FKey FName to Custom Representation
- [ ] Input Preview (HUD), Display Input Triggered
- [ ] Populate Input String Data Table
- [ ]
